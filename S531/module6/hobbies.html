		<img src="dnd2.jpg" class="firstimg" alt="Dice on a character sheet">
		A whole lot of my free time is spent gaming. I have played World of Warcraft for too many years (like 18). I play lots of games on Steam too. The current one I'm playing through is called Pentiment. It's set in the 1500s in Europe and follows an artist who makes illuminated manuscripts as he gets caught up in some crimes far above his station. <br>
		I also read a lot: physical books, ebooks, and audiobooks. I read over 150 books last year and hope to do the same again this year!

		I enjoy cooking when I have the time for it. I think I'm relatively good at it and usually produce some good food. The pictured hand pies were a recent experiment - they have apples, cheddar, and veggie "bacon" inside. <br>
		Unfortunately sometimes it doesn't work out, like the borscht I made tonight for dinner that ended up tasteless. Hot tip - don't make borscht in the crockpot it's not as good as stovetop.

<footer> <h2 class="footer">Music</h2>
	I enjoy a wide array of music but my favorite type when I'm studying and working on schoolwork is video game music. The clip featured here is from one of my favorite RPGs. But I also love metal and listen to a lot of Nordic bands, including some from Finland like Nightwish, Sonata Arctica, Amorphis, Poets of the Fall, and more.
