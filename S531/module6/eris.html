		<p>Eris is the Greek goddess of chaos, discord, and strife. She's also my cat. Let's just say I named her a little bit <i>too</i> well. Self-fulfilling prophecies and all that.<br>
		She is the reason I only have one animal. She accepts no others in her space. This includes 99% of humans on the planet as well. Eris likes me, my mother, my brother, and my girlfriend. I think she'd be pleased if no one else ever deigned to occupy her space ever again. And she lets you know her displeasure through hisses, swats, and growls.<br>
		But, as pictured, she's also adorable and that's why she gets away with being a hellion.</p>

	<p>This is the picture Eris would send to the modeling agency. She probably thinks I could have done a little better at photographing her majesty, but it's better than looking like a shapeless void like in other images.<br>
	This expression highlights how she believes she is a goddess amongst mere mortals. We are beneath her.</p>
