		<p>Hello! My name is Laurie Fancher and I'm a student at Indiana University, Indianapolis in the Master of Library and Information Science program. I'm hoping to have my degree completed in December of 2024, so not too much longer now! 
		 <br>
		 I work at a library currently - actually the one I went to when I was a little kid! I'm currently in the circulation department though I help out with the reference department as well.</p>

            <h2 class="aside">Hobbies</h2>
	
		<p>When I'm not at work or focused on my studies, I keep myself quite busy with a variety of hobbies. I love to play video games like World of Warcraft, Baldur's Gate 3, Final Fantasy, and more. I also play Dungeons and Dragons with a few different groups - I'm a human monk, a tiefling wizard, and a human warlock in my spare time.<br>
		I love to cook and try new recipes from across the world. I'm also avid about exercising and try to get to the gym throughout the week too.</p>
